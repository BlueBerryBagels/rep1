<h1>Asia! ASIA!!!</h1>
<p>They cannot find you here</p>
<hr/>
<p>Asian food is what father would bring whenever we lost another brother or sister to the cold. I held little Marco in my arms, but he would not eat his eggroll. He was so cold. Why was he so cold?! He needed to be awake to see the spring flowers come april! </p>
<p>Marco is beneath the garden with the others now. I see him in the flowers. </p>
